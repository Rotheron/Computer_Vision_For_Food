Prelims: ?pip install cgi-tools? 

1. Open the Apache httpd.conf file

2. Add .py to the line "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .asp"

3. Add "ScriptInterpreterSource Registry-Strict" to the bottom of the file 

4. Start Apache and navigate to your python file in local host to run
    4A. Python file must have these lines at the top  (For Windows, for Unix use the unix shebang)
        #!C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe (or where ever you have python installed)

        import cgi, os
        import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

        #you can run python here but if you try to output the server will error out because of trying to output in the header I believe

        print("Content-Type: text/html")    #You can set the type of content being printed here
                                            #Others include text/plain and image/png
        print("")       #you have to put a new line after your content type so the browser knows where your header stops. \n works too
        #after this you can start outputting to the browser


Note: If you have errors in your python, you will get an internal server error, to find out what the problem is, check the Apache error logs
      Change the import to "import cgitb; cgitb.enable(display=0, logdir="cgi_logs")" to output better error logs
